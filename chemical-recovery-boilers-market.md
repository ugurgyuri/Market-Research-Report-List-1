<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Recovery Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Recovery Boilers (Below 3,000 tds/d)</li><li>Large Recovery Boilers (Above 3,000 tds/d)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemical recovery boilers market can be divided into two main types based on their capacity. Small recovery boilers, typically processing less than 3,000 tons of dry solids per day (tds/d), are suitable for smaller pulp and paper mills with lower production volumes. In contrast, large recovery boilers, exceeding 3,000 tds/d, are designed for larger facilities that require higher capacities to efficiently recover chemicals from black liquor. Both types play crucial roles in improving sustainability and energy efficiency in industrial operations.</p></p>
