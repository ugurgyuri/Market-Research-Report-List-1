<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Composites Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental composites market is divided into two main types: direct and indirect composites. Direct composites are applied directly to the tooth cavity during an appointment, allowing for immediate shaping and curing. They offer convenience and are ideal for smaller restorations. Indirect composites, on the other hand, are created in a laboratory after impressions are taken. These materials allow for more precision and strength, making them suitable for larger restorations, such as crowns and bridges. Each type serves distinct clinical needs.</p></p>
